# VolumeBox
A box that tries to calculate volumes of objects based on two cameras.

Two cameras set up in a jig are pointed at the same object. One camera will get a side view of the object, the other camera will get a top view of the object. By running a shape recognition algorithm on both images, the 3D shape of the object can be discerned. 

Initially only cuboids will be used, in order to simplify the process necessary.
